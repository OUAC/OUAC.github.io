                 Basically how do we make machines not only do things which it is programmed to do the time when it is programmed, but rather programme a way to let it find what it should do, over some sort of experience?<br>
                 Well it turns out that we could use mathematical models. By having a rule to change the mathematical model, according to inputs and outputs of the model over time, we can eventually lead the model to produce certain outputs, according to our inputs. And hopefully the model will thereby capture some sort of relation, which connects our inputs to desired outputs.<br>
                 Concretely,<br>
                 for example: Our inputs can be pictures of cats and dogs, which are 200 x 200<br>
                 pixeled images. And our outputs could be the labels which are given to these images, (1 for cat, and 0 for dog) for instance, then : (0,1,0,1,0… etc) as an example for (dog,cat,dog,cat,dog… etc).<br>
                 Our model can be any function which takes 200 * 200 numbers as an input, and outputs a single number, from 0 to 1.<br>
                 For instance a polynomial with 40000 (200*200) terms would be a function that<br>
                 will work (well, not really that well, but it can be a function that is used)</p>
